# Teach Insight Workspace (Local Only)

This directory stores local teaching progress and insight notes for the `teach` workflow.

Scope:
- Session progress and checkpoints
- Learning-oriented subsystem reports
- Evidence-backed insights for developer follow-up

Local-only behavior:
- Keep this directory untracked.
- Do not add allowlist rules in `.gitignore`.

Suggested files:
- `current.md` - active teaching context and next checkpoint
- `insights.md` - append-only concise insight log
- `index.md` - quick index of saved sessions
- `sessions/*.md` - timestamped full-scan and deep-dive reports

Security:
- Do not store secrets, tokens, credentials, or private keys.
