description: Expand a task into clear subtasks with dependencies.

## Steps
1. Read task details and acceptance criteria.
2. Create 3-7 subtasks with explicit outcomes.
3. Add dependencies and testStrategy for each subtask.
4. Keep tasks small and time-bounded.
5. Do not attach PRD links to subtasks; PRD linkage is tag-level defaults plus optional task-level overrides.
