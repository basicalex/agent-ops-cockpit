description: Use the MoreMotion Remotion repo to create animations in a React project.
---

## When to use
Use this when a project needs motion design, UI demos, or animated tutorials.

## Workflow
1. Ensure the MoreMotion repo is present (use `aoc-momo init`).
2. Import project components into MoreMotion compositions.
3. Use the Remotion preview loop for rapid iteration.
4. Record the preview if needed, then post-process with your crop script.

## Notes
- MoreMotion lives in a gitignored folder inside the project.
- Keep animations in sync with the product UI.
