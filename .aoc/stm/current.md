- [2026-02-26 08:06] [2026-02-26 07:xx] Follow-up cleanup per user request: removed PI-R from active runtime/installer/control surfaces (aoc-agent/aoc-agent-run/aoc-agent-install/aoc-control), deleted bin/aoc-pi-r, removed PI-R consent/licensing hooks from install.sh, updated docs/env references to PI-only npm runtime, updated smoke tests to assert pi-r rejection/absence, and rebuilt aoc-control for Alt+C parity.
- [2026-02-26 08:17] [2026-02-26 08:xx] Completed zero-string cleanup for PI-R tokens in active source/docs/scripts: removed remaining pi-r/AOC_PIR references outside AOC memory/history, updated smoke tests to use generic unsupported agents, and validated via bash -n + PI smoke scripts.
- [2026-02-26 09:48] [2026-02-26 08:xx] Added PI-first extensibility docs: new docs/agent-extensibility.md with BYO wrapper flow via AOC_AGENT_CMD+aoc-agent-wrap; linked from README/agents/config; corrected mission-control-ops stale codex fallback docs; hardened aoc-agent-wrap env hint generation for custom agent IDs by sanitizing to valid env var tokens.
