- [2026-02-25 16:39] [2026-02-25 16:xx] Completed tasks 127+128: added scripts/pi/test-aoc-init-pi-first.sh smoke test (fresh + migration flows), added legacy migration logic in aoc-init (.aoc -> .pi non-destructive with tmcc alias cleanup), updated README/docs/agents/docs/skills/docs/configuration and CHANGELOG with PI-first migration checklist + rollback notes, and marked tasks 125-128 done.
- [2026-02-25 16:44] [2026-02-25 16:xx] Completed Task 108 subtask 2: added session-scoped observer queue/debounce + one-active-run enforcement, semantic observer distiller path with PI adapter shell + deterministic fallback provenance, and sidecar/tests; marked tm sub done 108 2 --tag mind.
- [2026-02-25 16:46] [2026-02-25 16:46] Added task 130 (PI-only lockdown) under aoc/pi_cleanup with 7 subtasks covering contract, agent selection gating, launcher/installer disablement, skill/task flow simplification, docs/config updates, PI-only regression tests, and release closeout sequencing.
- [2026-02-25 17:02] [2026-02-25 17:0x] Started task 130 PI-only lockdown: gated aoc-agent/aoc-agent-run/aoc-agent-install + aoc-control to pi/pi-r only; hard-disabled non-PI wrappers (codex/gemini/cc/oc/kimi/omo and aliases) with clear deprecation messages; constrained aoc-skill to PI target; removed OmO cleanup exceptions; updated README/docs/config/install/changelog; added scripts/pi/test-pi-only-agent-surface.sh and validated with bash -n, cargo check -p aoc-control, aoc-skill validate, PI smoke tests.
- [2026-02-25 17:46] [2026-02-25 16:xx] Added Task 108 subtask 7 and completed it: observer trigger hooks (manual/task-complete/token-threshold), trigger priorities + debounce bypass for manual, sidecar trigger-specific enqueue APIs, and trigger metadata in run outcomes; tests passing; tm sub done 108 7 --tag mind.
- [2026-02-25 17:47] [2026-02-25 16:xx] Planned UI follow-up for observer pane: added Task 131 (mind tag) to replace top-right aoc-pulse with per-session observer feed; subtasks for feed event contract, pane UI, and manual/task-complete trigger wiring.
- [2026-02-26 07:12] [2026-02-26 07:12] HANDOFF (task 130 PI-only lockdown): Added subtask 8 (depends on subtask 7): 'Remove PI-only deprecation stubs and finalize README PI-only position'. No implementation started for subtask 8. Current state: task 130 in-progress with subtasks 1-6 done, 7 pending, 8 pending. Scope completed so far: PI-only gating in aoc-agent/aoc-agent-run/aoc-agent-install/aoc-control; non-PI wrappers hard-disabled with deprecation messages; aoc-skill constrained to PI target; cleanup/doctor/docs aligned for PI-only behavior; tests added. Validation already green on current branch: bash -n for touched scripts, aoc-skill validate --root ., cargo check --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml -p aoc-control, bash scripts/pi/test-aoc-init-pi-first.sh, bash scripts/pi/test-pi-only-agent-surface.sh. Key touched paths: bin/aoc-agent, bin/aoc-agent-run, bin/aoc-agent-install, bin/aoc-skill, bin/aoc-cleanup, bin/aoc-doctor, bin/aoc-launch, bin/aoc-new-tab, bin/aoc-{codex,gemini,cc,oc,kimi,omo,codex-tab}, bin/{codex,gemini,claude,opencode,kimi}, bin/aoc-opencode-profile, crates/aoc-control/src/main.rs, README.md, docs/{agents,configuration,installation,skills}.md, CHANGELOG.md, scripts/pi/test-pi-only-agent-surface.sh. Next execution order: complete subtask 7 release closeout/checklist first, then subtask 8 cleanup pass (remove deprecation stubs/messages and keep final concise README PI-only statement).
