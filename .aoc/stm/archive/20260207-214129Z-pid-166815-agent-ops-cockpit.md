- [2026-02-07 22:41] 2026-02-07: Completed Task 68 (mission-control Pulse UDS integration) in pulse-hub-spoke.
- [2026-02-07 22:41] Mission-control now uses aoc_core pulse_ipc over session-scoped UDS pulse.sock (hello+subscribe, snapshot/delta/heartbeat ingest, reconnect backoff, disconnect cache clear).
- [2026-02-07 22:41] Command path wired: Overview Enter emits focus_tab command via hub; Overview x emits stop_agent command via hub; command_result request_id correlation updates status note.
- [2026-02-07 22:41] Session/auth semantics aligned with pulse_ipc and hub enforcement: version/session checks on inbound envelopes and subscriber-role command usage via hub.
- [2026-02-07 22:41] Overview attention sorting now prioritizes error/offline/needs-input states; lifecycle + snippet surfaced in rows; local collectors still provide fallback when hub data absent.
- [2026-02-07 22:41] Tests passed: cargo test -p aoc-mission-control (3/3) and cargo test -p aoc-hub-rs pulse_uds (8/8).
- [2026-02-07 22:41] Taskmaster updated: task 68 marked done; task 69 pending. Memory updated with major decision note for Pulse UDS integration and command flow.
- [2026-02-07 22:41] Working tree intentionally dirty: crates/Cargo.lock, crates/aoc-mission-control/Cargo.toml, crates/aoc-mission-control/src/main.rs. No commit created.
