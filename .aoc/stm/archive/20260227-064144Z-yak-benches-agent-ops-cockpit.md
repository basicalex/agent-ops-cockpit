- [2026-02-27 07:41] Theming work summary (AOC/Zellij/Pi): implemented live preview flow in aoc-control Theme Manager (j/k preview, Enter select fallback, Esc restore fallback+back, a actions).
- [2026-02-27 07:41] Control stability fixes: removed immediate apply on entering preset/custom lists; added cooked-mode guard around theme command execution; added timeout-kill guard around preview apply to avoid hard hangs.
- [2026-02-27 07:41] aoc-theme parser now supports both RGB and hex KDL palette values (fixed everforest parse failure).
- [2026-02-27 07:41] Unified cross-surface sync: aoc-theme apply/sync writes ~/.config/aoc/theme.env, ~/.config/yazi/theme.toml, ~/.pi/agent/themes/aoc-live.json, ~/.pi/agent/settings.json (theme=aoc-live). theme.env now exports AOC_PI_THEME_NAME/PATH/SETTINGS_PATH and AOC_PI_THEME_LOCKED=1.
- [2026-02-27 07:41] themeMap.ts updated to honor AOC_PI_THEME_NAME first and respect AOC_PI_THEME_LOCKED to prevent extension defaults overriding active AOC-driven Pi theme.
- [2026-02-27 07:41] Added canonical command: aoc-theme activate --name <theme> (live apply when session available + set-default + artifact sync). TUI and aoc-control combined action (Apply now + set default) now route through activate.
- [2026-02-27 07:41] Preset catalog expanded to include Pi extension-mapped themes (catppuccin-mocha, cyberpunk, midnight-ocean, ocean-breeze, synthwave) in addition to core AOC presets. aoc-control preset classification list updated accordingly.
- [2026-02-27 07:41] Alt+c/control pane: direct keybind run (aoc-control-toggle) for speed, hardened duplicate-pane detection in toggle script by matching pane command containing aoc-control* as well as pane name.
- [2026-02-27 07:41] aoc-init seeding fix: setup_pi_extensions now reliably seeds .pi/extensions/minimal.ts and .pi/extensions/themeMap.ts via canonical dirs + discovery + builtin fallback, and caches templates under ~/.config/aoc/pi/extensions. Verified in /home/ceii/dev/voyager.
- [2026-02-27 07:41] Current open issue: live preview sometimes times out in Theme Manager (status: timed out after 900ms was seen; guard increased to 2200ms and timeout messaging softened). Need re-verify in-session for parasite pane/glitch absence and preview reliability.
- [2026-02-27 07:41] Uncommitted repo files related to this work: bin/aoc-theme, crates/aoc-control/src/main.rs, .pi/extensions/themeMap.ts, bin/aoc-init, .pi/skills/zellij-theme-ops/SKILL.md, .aoc/skills/zellij-theme-ops/SKILL.md; plus state/docs: .aoc/context.md, .aoc/memory.md, .taskmaster/state.json, .pi/skills/.aoc-skill-sync, .gitignore.
