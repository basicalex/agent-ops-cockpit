- [2026-02-06 12:31] Task: Mission Control / AOC Pulse rollout and telemetry wiring stabilization.
- [2026-02-06 12:31] Implemented: top-right layout now single AOC Pulse pane (Widget/Clock removed), bottom-right terminal preserved; env injection for AOC_SESSION_ID/AOC_PANE_ID/AOC_PROJECT_ROOT/AOC_HUB_ADDR/AOC_HUB_URL in launch/new-tab layout rendering.
- [2026-02-06 12:31] Implemented: hub startup fix in aoc-launch + aoc-new-tab (removed duplicate --session/--addr when invoking aoc-hub wrapper); this resolved hub startup failure seen as 'argument --session cannot be used multiple times'.
- [2026-02-06 12:31] Implemented: stable identity model in telemetry publisher as session_id::pane_id (agent label kept as metadata).
- [2026-02-06 12:31] Implemented: AOC Pulse v1/v2 in aoc-mission-control (Overview/Work/Diff/Health), hub-preferred with local fallback; no agent-thought parsing.
- [2026-02-06 12:31] Implemented: wrapper/opencode startup compatibility fix — aoc-agent-wrap-rs defaults PTY OFF (AOC_AGENT_PTY=0 unless overridden), uses direct inherited stdio in piped mode; aoc-agent-wrap now prefers AOC_PROJECT_ROOT/.aoc and prints proper agent label.
- [2026-02-06 12:31] Installed locally: updated ~/.local/bin/aoc-launch, aoc-new-tab, aoc-agent-wrap, plus cargo-installed ~/.local/bin/aoc-hub-rs, aoc-agent-wrap-rs, aoc-mission-control.
- [2026-02-06 12:31] Validation run: cargo check crates workspace + targeted crates passed; bash -n on updated scripts passed; smoke tests confirmed no-hub fallback snapshot writing and hub identity separation across pane IDs.
- [2026-02-06 12:31] Current user status: reports wrapper/opencode blocking issue now addressed by PTY-off default and wrapper updates; user will restart/new session manually to verify.
