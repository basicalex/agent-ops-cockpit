- [2026-02-15 19:11] Theme handoff: integrated Theme Manager into aoc-control Settings (presets/custom/create/install-all/actions), removed Alt+t keybind from template/docs, and routed live apply through interactive command path to avoid output-capture panic. Alt+c launcher now ensures floating panes are visible before launch, no-ops if Control already exists, and drains residual tty input so immediate Esc close works. Remaining uncertainty: broader session-modes/regression coverage for theme apply + set-default across varied zellij states still needs explicit smoke matrix.
- [2026-02-19 13:29] Handoff (future roadmap): extend new Bash layout shortcut system with shell parity for zsh and fish so aoc.<layout> and aoc. tab-complete work cross-shell, while keeping aoc as default launch.
- [2026-02-19 13:29] Handoff (OpenCode UX): implement active sub-agent display stack modeled after oh-my-opencode via plugin/config layer + session-scoped active-agent tracking, then bridge selected sub-agent into wrapper header/title/env.
- [2026-02-19 13:29] Handoff (planned tasks): complete sub-agent rotation sequence: #58 define config/state schema + fallbacks, #59 Shift+Tab rotation plugin preserving Tab behavior, #60 wrapper surfacing of active sub-agent, #61 docs/tests/seeding flow for project portability.
- [2026-02-19 13:29] Open design decision pending: choose whether to fully remap/demote plan/build like oh-my-opencode or keep native plan/build and only overlay active sub-agent display + Shift+Tab rotation.
