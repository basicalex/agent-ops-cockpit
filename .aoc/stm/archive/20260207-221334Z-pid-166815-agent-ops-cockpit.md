- [2026-02-07 22:41] 2026-02-07: Completed Task 68 (mission-control Pulse UDS integration) in pulse-hub-spoke.
- [2026-02-07 22:41] Mission-control now uses aoc_core pulse_ipc over session-scoped UDS pulse.sock (hello+subscribe, snapshot/delta/heartbeat ingest, reconnect backoff, disconnect cache clear).
- [2026-02-07 22:41] Command path wired: Overview Enter emits focus_tab command via hub; Overview x emits stop_agent command via hub; command_result request_id correlation updates status note.
- [2026-02-07 22:41] Session/auth semantics aligned with pulse_ipc and hub enforcement: version/session checks on inbound envelopes and subscriber-role command usage via hub.
- [2026-02-07 22:41] Overview attention sorting now prioritizes error/offline/needs-input states; lifecycle + snippet surfaced in rows; local collectors still provide fallback when hub data absent.
- [2026-02-07 22:41] Tests passed: cargo test -p aoc-mission-control (3/3) and cargo test -p aoc-hub-rs pulse_uds (8/8).
- [2026-02-07 22:41] Taskmaster updated: task 68 marked done; task 69 pending. Memory updated with major decision note for Pulse UDS integration and command flow.
- [2026-02-07 22:41] Working tree intentionally dirty: crates/Cargo.lock, crates/aoc-mission-control/Cargo.toml, crates/aoc-mission-control/src/main.rs. No commit created.
- [2026-02-07 23:13] 2026-02-07 handoff: Task 69 completed and committed as b8e9c1b (feat(pulse): add rollout guardrails and pulse observability). Added AOC_PULSE_VNEXT_ENABLED rollback gate in hub+mission-control, structured pulse latency/backpressure/parser-confidence/layout-watcher observability, stress benchmark for 5/10/20 agents with tab churn, rollout doc docs/pulse-vnext-rollout.md, Taskmaster 69 marked done, memory updated with rollout and canary verification.
- [2026-02-07 23:13] Next session target: implement typed Pulse message coverage for task_summary/diff_summary/health so mission-control Work/Diff/Health are fully Pulse-driven, then add command lifecycle state semantics and CI perf-gated stress assertions.
