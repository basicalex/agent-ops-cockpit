- [2026-02-07 21:31] OBJECTIVE: Execute Pulse vNext implementation under Taskmaster tag pulse-hub-spoke (tasks 62-69), delivering passive hub + active wrapper transparent tap architecture with near-real-time pane lifecycle updates.
- [2026-02-07 21:31] DONE: Created tag pulse-hub-spoke; added tasks 62-69 with dependencies; initialized and linked PRD for task 62 at .taskmaster/docs/prds/62-define-pulse-vnext-architecture-and-prd.md; set active tag to pulse-hub-spoke; recorded architecture decision in aoc-mem.
- [2026-02-07 21:31] IN PROGRESS: No code implementation started yet for tasks 63-69. Planning is complete and ready for execution in dependency order.
- [2026-02-07 21:31] BLOCKED: None. Main known constraints: zellij dump-screen cannot target background panes; zellij write-chars/close-pane are not pane-targetable in current CLI, so command path must be Pulse->Hub->Wrapper for per-agent control.
- [2026-02-07 21:31] KEY FILES/STATE: PRD=.taskmaster/docs/prds/62-define-pulse-vnext-architecture-and-prd.md ; tasks=.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json (via aoc-task only). Existing unrelated dirty files in repo: bin/aoc-agent-wrap, bin/aoc-cleanup, crates/aoc-hub-rs/src/main.rs. Last Pulse UI commit: c184636.
- [2026-02-07 21:31] OPEN DECISIONS/ASSUMPTIONS: Shared IPC types should live in aoc-core (preferred over new crate). UDS path should be session-scoped /run/user/<uid>/aoc/<session>/pulse.sock with 0600 perms. Keep websocket path/fallback until rollout flag proves stable.
- [2026-02-07 21:31] NEXT STEPS: (1) Task 63 implement NDJSON WireMsg + framing in shared module with tests. (2) Task 64 add UDS server/state store/snapshot+delta broadcast in aoc-hub-rs. (3) Task 65 add fast dump-layout watcher (200-300ms) with immediate pane-close prune. (4) Task 66 implement wrapper ring buffer + debounced parser/reporter (250ms) without hot-path blocking. (5) Task 67 wire command routing and SIGINT-safe child control, then Task 68 mission-control integration and Task 69 observability/benchmark rollout.
