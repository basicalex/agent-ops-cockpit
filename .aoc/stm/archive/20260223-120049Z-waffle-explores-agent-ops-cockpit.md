- [2026-02-23 13:00] Objective + active tag/tasks: complete mind tasks 101-105 and hand off next workstream. Active tag: mind. Next task: 106 (then 107, 108, 109, 110).
- [2026-02-23 13:00] Done: implemented contracts in aoc-core (raw/T0 schemas, deterministic compaction/hash, T1 scope guard, T2 same-tag aggregation policy, context-pack precedence); added storage crate with SQLite migration/schema and checkpoint APIs; added opencode adapter crate with incremental ingestion, partial/corrupt tolerance, truncation recovery, Taskmaster signal parsing, and context state snapshots; added task attribution crate with artifact-task links (active/mentioned/worked_on/completed) and late-completion backfill over context timeline + T0 evidence.
- [2026-02-23 13:00] In progress: integration wiring from ingestion/distillation pipeline into attribution and upcoming segment router (106).
- [2026-02-23 13:00] Blockers/risks: no hard blockers. Risk areas are command-shape variance for Taskmaster signal parsing and heuristic task-id mention extraction quality; both covered with deterministic tests but may need broader fixtures.
- [2026-02-23 13:00] Files touched (key): crates/aoc-core/src/mind_contracts.rs; crates/aoc-storage/Cargo.toml; crates/aoc-storage/migrations/0001_mind_schema.sql; crates/aoc-storage/src/lib.rs; crates/aoc-opencode-adapter/Cargo.toml; crates/aoc-opencode-adapter/src/lib.rs; crates/aoc-task-attribution/Cargo.toml; crates/aoc-task-attribution/src/lib.rs; crates/Cargo.toml; crates/Cargo.lock.
- [2026-02-23 13:00] Last command outcomes (tests/build): cargo test -p aoc-core passed (14 tests); cargo test -p aoc-storage passed (5 tests); cargo test -p aoc-opencode-adapter passed (5 tests); cargo test -p aoc-task-attribution passed (2 tests).
- [2026-02-23 13:00] Open decisions/assumptions: T1 remains strictly per-conversation; T2 may aggregate across T1 observations within same tag/workstream; cross-tag T2 mixing remains off by default unless policy enables global synthesis.
- [2026-02-23 13:00] Next steps: (1) wire attribution engine into artifact production flow so links are generated automatically, (2) implement task 106 Taskmaster-first segment routing with override provenance, (3) begin task 107 deterministic T1/T2 runtime wiring on top of T0 lane, (4) add integration fixtures combining ingestion->attribution->routing, (5) update task/memory state after each phase gate.
