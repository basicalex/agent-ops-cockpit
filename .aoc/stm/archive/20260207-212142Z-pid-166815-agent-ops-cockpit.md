- [2026-02-07 22:21] Session handoff prepared for pulse-hub-spoke continuation.
- [2026-02-07 22:21] Completed in this session: Task 67 (command routing + SIGINT-safe control path) and marked done in Taskmaster.
- [2026-02-07 22:21] Hub changes in crates/aoc-hub-rs/src/pulse_uds.rs: subscriber-role enforcement, session-scoped target checks, stop_agent forwarding with accepted ack, hub-side focus_tab action, command_result helpers, and request_id idempotency cache.
- [2026-02-07 22:21] Wrapper changes in crates/aoc-agent-wrap-rs/src/main.rs: Ctrl-C handling now escalates SIGINT -> SIGTERM -> SIGKILL with grace timeouts for both piped and PTY child paths.
- [2026-02-07 22:21] Tests added: hub command route/ack + duplicate request id + command error coverage; wrapper escalation test for ignored SIGINT child.
- [2026-02-07 22:21] Validation run passed: cargo test -p aoc-hub-rs -p aoc-agent-wrap-rs.
- [2026-02-07 22:21] Tag status now: pulse-hub-spoke tasks 63,64,65,66,67 done; tasks 68 (mission-control UDS integration) and 69 (observability/rollout) pending.
- [2026-02-07 22:21] Working tree is intentionally dirty with prior in-progress pulse files (including crates/aoc-core/src/pulse_ipc.rs and docs/pulse-ipc-protocol.md) plus current updates; no commit was created.
- [2026-02-07 22:21] Next agent should start task 68: wire aoc-mission-control to Pulse UDS snapshot/delta/command flow, then run targeted tests.
