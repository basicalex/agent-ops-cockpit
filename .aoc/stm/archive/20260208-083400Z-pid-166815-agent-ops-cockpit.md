- [2026-02-08 09:33] Objective: polish AOC Pulse pane UX and stabilize hub-authoritative rendering during transient reconnects while keeping typed Pulse data flow end-to-end.

Done:
- Committed wrapper publisher integration: 3b5f5ca (typed Pulse source sections task_summaries/task_summary, diff_summary, health; stop_agent command_result semantics).
- Committed mission-control flicker/churn fix: 23a08c3 (2s reconnect grace, hub snapshot hold, hub=reconnecting label, no local-only row injection while hub data is preferred).
- Added tests for reconnect grace and overview row source behavior in mission-control.
- Recorded architecture/polish decisions in memory with aoc-mem add.

In progress:
- None active at handoff; Pulse pane UX polish target complete for current scope.

Blocked:
- None.

Files touched (this phase):
- crates/aoc-agent-wrap-rs/src/main.rs
- crates/aoc-mission-control/src/main.rs

Validation outcomes:
- cargo test -p aoc-agent-wrap-rs => pass (7/7)
- cargo test -p aoc-mission-control => pass (10/10 after polish tests)
- cargo test -p aoc-hub-rs => pass (8/8, 1 ignored benchmark)
- cargo build --release -p aoc-agent-wrap-rs -p aoc-mission-control -p aoc-hub-rs => pass

Open decisions / assumptions:
- Keep AOC_PULSE_VNEXT_ENABLED rollout guard in place.
- Keep local fallback behavior, but delay fallback for HUB_RECONNECT_GRACE_SECS to suppress one-tick mode/source flips.
- Keep hub as authoritative source for overview/work/diff/health whenever hub cache is present during reconnect grace.

Next 3-5 concrete steps:
1) Run in live session and verify no single-frame hub->local flicker under tab churn/reconnect.
2) Continue Pulse roadmap: command lifecycle semantics hardening and explicit accepted/terminal states in UI notes.
3) Add CI perf-gated stress assertion for tab churn + reconnect to prevent regressions.
4) Decide whether reconnect grace should be env-configurable for tuning in different environments.
