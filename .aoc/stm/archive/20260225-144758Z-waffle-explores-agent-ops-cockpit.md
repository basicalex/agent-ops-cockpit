- [2026-02-25 15:47] PI-first cleanup planning complete. Created Taskmaster tag aoc/pi_cleanup and linked PRD .taskmaster/docs/prds/aoc_pi_cleanup_prd_rpg.md. Tasks created: 121(contract), 122(init determinism), 123(prompt canonicalization), 124(skill canonicalization), 125(remove non-PI scaffolding/docs), 126(existing repo migration), 127(validation tests), 128(release docs/checklist).
- [2026-02-25 15:47] Key decisions: PI-first recommended for agent runtime assets; keep .aoc as AOC control plane (.aoc/context.md, memory, stm, rtk, layouts). Canonical PI assets should live under .pi (settings.json, prompts, skills, extensions).
- [2026-02-25 15:47] Current implementation status: tmcc alias removed in this repo; tm-cc retained. aoc-init now seeds .pi/settings.json when missing. In honk-land, .pi/settings.json was missing and created; stale .pi/prompts/tmcc.md removed there. Note: honk-land .aoc/skills/tmcc may still exist and should be cleaned during migration task 126.
- [2026-02-25 15:47] Next steps for next agent: (1) Start task 121 in-progress and finalize PI-first ownership contract with explicit canonical paths + compatibility window. (2) Implement task 122/123/124 in small PRs with idempotent aoc-init behavior and no destructive overwrites. (3) Add migration/repair logic for existing repos including alias cleanup (task 126). (4) Add smoke tests for fresh/existing repo init (task 127). (5) Update docs/release notes and close tasks (task 128).
