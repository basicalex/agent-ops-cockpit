- [2026-02-23 13:10] [2026-02-23 13:00] Completed task 106: added aoc-segment-routing engine (Taskmaster-first tag map, heuristic fallback, uncertain/global buckets, override patch provenance) plus segment-route persistence APIs and routing regression fixtures.
- [2026-02-23 15:09] [2026-02-23 13:00] Completed task 107: added aoc-mind deterministic T1/T2 runtime over T0 lane with strict per-conversation T1 scope, under-budget single-pass, over-budget deterministic chunking, bounded output synthesis, deterministic artifact IDs/traceability, optional attribution pass, and budget-policy fixtures.
- [2026-02-23 15:30] HANDOFF: User wants stable split agents: oc and omo in separate tabs via Alt+C and wrapper commands.
- [2026-02-23 15:30] What was fixed: launch-agent routing now uses AOC_LAUNCH_AGENT_ID to avoid session env bleed. Updated control + launch scripts and agent wrappers to pass launch agent explicitly.
- [2026-02-23 15:30] Files touched for routing: crates/aoc-control/src/main.rs, bin/aoc-new-tab, bin/aoc-launch, bin/aoc-agent, bin/aoc-oc, bin/aoc-cc, bin/aoc-gemini, bin/aoc-kimi, bin/aoc-omo, plus mirrored runtime copies under /home/ceii/.local/bin/.
- [2026-02-23 15:30] OmO profile readiness improvements: aoc-omo now has auto verify/install bootstrap path and seeds provider config from main profile when sandbox lacks providers. Sandbox config at /home/ceii/.config/aoc/opencode/profiles/sandbox/opencode.json was repaired and plugin registration added.
- [2026-02-23 15:30] Observed remaining failure: OmO shows startup banner then exits quickly. Telemetry often shows running then stale; wrapper logs for failing panes only show initial running transition with no graceful offline update, suggesting external kill path not clean app exit.
- [2026-02-23 15:30] Evidence paths: /home/ceii/.local/state/aoc/telemetry/waffle-explores/78.json, /home/ceii/dev/agent-ops-cockpit/.aoc/logs/aoc-agent-wrap-waffle-explores-waffle-explores__78.log, /home/ceii/.local/state/aoc/cleanup.log.
- [2026-02-23 15:30] Important user constraint: DO NOT run opencode, aoc-agent-run, aoc-omo, or install-omo live in this shared pane/session. These commands can terminate the active session.
- [2026-02-23 15:30] Likely root cause now: cleanup/reaper/watchdog interaction still killing omo panes after spawn. Next clean-session debug should add explicit per-pane stderr capture and temporarily hard-disable all cleanup/watchdog logic for agent_id=omo to confirm.
