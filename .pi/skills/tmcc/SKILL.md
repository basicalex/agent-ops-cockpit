description: Alias skill for tm-cc cross-project Taskmaster control.

Use the exact `tm-cc` workflow.

- Prefer explicit root targeting (`--tm-root <path>` or `AOC_TASKMASTER_ROOT`).
- Support full Taskmaster CRUD across projects.
- Keep handshake behavior unchanged; this mode is opt-in.

See canonical skill: `tm-cc`.
